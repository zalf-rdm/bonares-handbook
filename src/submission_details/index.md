**(Status: Submitted)**, it is possible to make changes. As soon as the data have been added to the database and the metadata have been sent 
**(Status: in progress)**, contact must be made with the BonaRes Centre for subsequent changes.

The history gives an overview of the completed processing steps of the respective dataset.

An overview of all datasets submitted so far appears in the user account under [“Submission”](https://tools.bonares.de/submission/) under **“My dataset submissions”**. If you have any questions or problems, the ticket number should always be given.

:::
After a dataset has been transferred to the BonaRes Centre, it is checked formally and in terms of content  (e. g. thematically fit into the BonaRes Repository) by data stewards. Formal checks are, e. g. empty columns, outliers or not plausible values. Conspicuous data are communicated back to the data provider. In the future, the test should carried out by an automated tool. After a dataset passed this formal check, further metadata will be prepared (see chapter Metadata), which can be downloaded as PDF.
