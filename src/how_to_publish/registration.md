!!!success  Note:
If the intention is to submit several datasets of a **research group**, it is possible to organize all of the associated data providers in one project in the BonaRes Repository. In this case, the [BonaRes Repository should be contacted](mailto:support-data@bonares.de) **BEFORE registration**, so the project can be created in advance. The same **project affiliation** allows you to search for specific project data. Pre-entries about shared templates within the project save time and effort when describing the metadata. The rights for editing the metadata are distributed in a targeted manner.
