# Dataset and Metada Submission

After completing the metadata template, click on the **“submit new dataset”** button and **fill** the upload form.

### Filling out the Upload form

The first step in the upload form is to provide a title and a brief but understandable description of the dataset – analogue to the abstract of a paper but specified to this data. This information is the basis of the metadata.
:::content-center
![_Upload form: Title and description of the dataset_](/static/img/fig_title_description.png)
:::
The project in which the data were collected must be specified in the following field. You can choose from the BonaRes collaborative projects and some long-term field experiments. For all other data that cannot be assigned to any of these projects, “Other” must be specified. In the future, it should also be possible to manually enter the individual projects.

:::
When selecting the research domain, the most appropriate domain should be selected. Only one domain can be selected. The research domains are based on the categories of the [German Research Foundation (DFG)](https://www.dfg.de/en/dfg_profile/statutory_bodies/review_boards/subject_areas/index.jsp) (FK No. 207 Agriculture, Forestry and Veterinary Medicine).

Now the research question for which the available data were determined can be specified. Of course, there are not "the" good and "the" bad data - but data are of high quality in relation to the research question they are supposed to answer. This enables the potential reuser to better assess the suitability of the data for her research.

!!!success Note:
Fields with two lines in the lower right corner can be enlarged if necessary.

If possible, one or more soil functions that match the dataset should be selected that address the underlying study.

In the next step, the dataset, metadata, any additional material, such as pictures, plans or drawings, can be uploaded. Please upload just the actual dataset (only **one** table, **one** dataset, one worksheet). **Multiple worksheets should be split** and uploaded separately.
To illustrate the research data, you can use a **data model** that shows the data, e.g. a diagram.

Afterwards, additional information can be given specifically for the BonaRes Centre. In addition, the BonaRes data guideline must be approved and assured that the authority exists to hand over the data to the repository and that it has not yet been published elsewhere. This means that the data owner does not necessarily have to submit the data himself and can also designate someone else as the data provider.

If all fields have been filled in, the dataset can be transferred to the BonaRes Centre by clicking on **“Submit”**. The BonaRes Centre sends an automatic **confirmation email** afterwards with a ticket number.

If the upload was successful, a summary of the submitted information appears. The processing status can also be viewed on this page. As long as the submitted data are formally checked

**(Status: Submitted)**, it is possible to make changes. As soon as the data have been added to the database and the metadata have been sent 
**(Status: in progress)**, contact must be made with the BonaRes Centre for subsequent changes.

The history gives an overview of the completed processing steps of the respective dataset.

An overview of all datasets submitted so far appears in the user account under [“Submission”](https://tools.bonares.de/submission/) under **“My dataset submissions”**. If you have any questions or problems, the ticket number should always be given.

:::
After a dataset has been transferred to the BonaRes Centre, it is checked formally and in terms of content  (e. g. thematically fit into the BonaRes Repository) by data stewards. Formal checks are, e. g. empty columns, outliers or not plausible values. Conspicuous data are communicated back to the data provider. In the future, the test should carried out by an automated tool. After a dataset passed this formal check, further metadata will be prepared (see chapter Metadata), which can be downloaded as PDF.

:::content
### Prepared metadata with **information from the upload tool and the data table:**
* Description: **Title, summary, research domain, research question, date of submission,** editor, reference system, geographical location (very rough)
* Categorization: **Project category**, standard keywords for BonaRes with associated thesaurus, topic category, **soil functions**
* Access: Restrictions on use, license for use
* Distribution: Output format, data provider
* Quality: Lineage statement
* Metadata: Metadata standard and version
* Data model: **First column descriptions of the data table**
