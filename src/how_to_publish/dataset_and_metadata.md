### Filling out the Upload form

The first step in the upload form is to provide a title and a brief but understandable description of the dataset – analogue to the abstract of a paper but specified to this data. This information is the basis of the metadata.

### Upload form: Selection of Project

The project in which the data were collected must be specified in the following field. You can choose from the BonaRes collaborative projects and some long-term field experiments. For all other data that cannot be assigned to any of these projects, “Other” must be specified. In the future, it should also be possible to manually enter the individual projects.

### Upload form: Selection of the relevant Research Domain

When selecting the research domain, the most appropriate domain should be selected. Only one domain can be selected. The research domains are based on the categories of the [German Research Foundation (DFG)](https://www.dfg.de/en/dfg_profile/statutory_bodies/review_boards/subject_areas/index.jsp) (FK No. 207 Agriculture, Forestry and Veterinary Medicine).

### Upload form: Specifying the research question

Now the research question for which the available data were determined can be specified. Of course, there are not "the" good and "the" bad data - but data are of high quality in relation to the research question they are supposed to answer. This enables the potential reuser to better assess the suitability of the data for her research.

!!!success Note:
Fields with two lines in the lower right corner can be enlarged if necessary.

If possible, one or more soil functions that match the dataset should be selected that address the underlying study.

### Upload form: Upload dataset, metadata and supplemental material

In the next step, the dataset, metadata, any additional material, such as pictures, plans or drawings, can be uploaded. Please upload just the actual dataset (only **one** table, **one** dataset, one worksheet). **Multiple worksheets should be split** and uploaded separately.
To illustrate the research data, you can use a **data model** that shows the data, e.g. a diagram.

Afterwards, additional information can be given specifically for the BonaRes Repository. In addition, the BonaRes data guideline must be approved and assured that the authority exists to hand over the data to the repository and that it has not yet been published elsewhere. This means that the data owner does not necessarily have to submit the data himself and can also designate someone else as the data provider.

If all fields have been filled in, the dataset can be transferred to the BonaRes Repository by clicking on **“Submit”**. The BonaRes Repository sends an automatic **confirmation email** afterwards with a ticket number.

### Upload form: Specification of additional information, consent to the data guideline and confirmation of the authorization and the first publication
