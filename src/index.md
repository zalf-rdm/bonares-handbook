# The BonaRes Repository

In the BonaRes Repository, digital research data of soil and agricultural sciences are 
published and made reusable for scientists and interested parties. This manual is primarily
aimed at beginners and is a step-by-step tutorial based on a simple use case. If you have
any questions or further needs regarding research data management do not hesitate to contact
our data stewards team: support-data@bonares.de.

The original version of this documentation is available in the 
[BonaRes Series](https://doi.org/10.20387/bonares-mvkn-a4mb) while the basic rules were
described in the [BonaRes Data Policy](https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.20387/BonaRes-RYCV-30RK).
