The research data should be prepared in such a way that easy reuse is possible. In principle, the data record should be tabular and column-based. In most cases, soil and agricultural data have a spatial reference. The spatial position of the measuring points or areas should be given in the table as detailed as possible.","A typical dataset for data transfer to the BonaRes Repository has the following properties:","Each column (attribute) of the table contains the attribute name in the first row and the attribute values in the following rows, which means the data within the table are column-oriented.","Each table or dataset must be given a short, concise name.","For widespread reuse, work should be done in English if possible.","Typically, each table contains the following standard column names:","Table 1: Example table with typical standard column names of a data table"]},{"l":"Formal criterias for datasets","p":["The following formal criteria for tabular data especially submitted as Excel files must be met:"]},{"l":"Table criteria","p":["No.","General criteria for tables","1","Tables are unformatted (do not contain graphical elements, colored lines, …)","2","There are no internal references or formulas within a table","3","Tables contain only one worksheet (avoid Excel folders with multiple sheets)"]},{"l":"Column criteria","p":["1","2","3","4","5","6","7","Column delimiter is consistent and clearly identifies throughout the table (e. g. ”;” or “,”)","Column names are a maximum of 30 characters long","Column names are only assigned once","Column names contain no spaces(an underscore „_“ is allowed to use), special characters, umlauts, “ß” or units","Column names do not start with a number","Criteria for column","Each column contains a unique attribute name (between upper and lower case not differentiated z.
